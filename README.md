# 🎮 Build Games with AI!

## How to Use (It's Really Simple!)

### Step 1: Build your game
In the terminal at the bottom, type:
```bash
python build_game.py
```

Then tell it what you want:
- "create a space invaders game"
- "make a button that counts clicks"
- "add a dinosaur that jumps when I press space"

### Step 2: See your game
1. Right-click on `index.html` 
2. Choose "Open with Live Server"
3. Your game opens in a browser!

### Step 3: Make it better
Run `python build_game.py` again and ask for changes:
- "make the button red"
- "add a high score"
- "make it harder"

The browser will auto-refresh when you save!

## Examples to Try

**Simple starter:**
```
create a clicking game with a button that counts clicks
```

**Then improve it:**
```
add a timer that counts down from 30 seconds
```

**Then make it fun:**
```
show "game over" when time runs out and display the final score
```

## Tips
- Start simple, then add features
- Be specific about what you want
- If something doesn't work, run the script again and say "fix the timer, it's not counting down"

**Have fun!** 🚀
