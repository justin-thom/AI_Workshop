# 🎮 Build Games with AI!

## How to Use

### Step 1: Start the Game Builder
In the terminal at the bottom, type:
```bash
python build_game.py
```

### Step 2: Open Your Game in a Browser
1. Right-click on `index.html` in the file explorer (left side)
2. Choose **"Open with Live Server"**
3. Your game opens in a browser!
4. Keep this browser tab open - it will auto-refresh when you make changes

### Step 3: Build Your Game by Chatting with Claude
Back in the terminal, just tell Claude what you want:
```
You: create a clicker game with a button that counts clicks

🤖 Claude is thinking...
✅ Updated index.html!
💡 Refresh your browser to see the changes

You: make the button big and red

🤖 Claude is thinking...
✅ Updated index.html!

You: add a high score that saves even when I close the browser
```

Keep chatting and your game keeps evolving!

### Step 4: View Your Changes
After each update, **refresh your browser** to see the changes.

*Tip: Keep the browser and terminal side-by-side so you can see both!*

## Commands

While chatting with Claude, you can also type:
- **`show`** - see your current game code
- **`restart`** - start a completely new game
- **`quit`** - exit (your game is saved in index.html)

## Example Session
```
You: create a space shooter game

✅ Updated index.html!

You: add enemy spaceships that move down the screen

✅ Updated index.html!

You: let me shoot them when I press spacebar

✅ Updated index.html!

You: add a score counter

✅ Updated index.html!
```

## Ideas to Try

**Simple starters:**
- "create a clicking game with a button that counts clicks"
- "make a memory card matching game"
- "build a simple maze where I move with arrow keys"

**Make it better:**
- "add a timer that counts down"
- "make it harder as the score increases"
- "add sound effects when I click"
- "change the colors to be more fun"

**Fix things:**
- "the button isn't working, can you fix it?"
- "make the text bigger so it's easier to read"
- "the game is too hard, make it easier"

## Tips for Success

✅ **Start simple** - Get something working first, then make it better  
✅ **Be specific** - "make the button blue and bigger" is better than "improve the button"  
✅ **Build gradually** - Add one feature at a time  
✅ **Test as you go** - Refresh the browser after each change to make sure it works  
✅ **Don't be afraid to experiment** - You can always type `restart` to begin fresh  

## Troubleshooting

**"I can't see my game"**
- Make sure you opened index.html with Live Server (right-click → Open with Live Server)
- Check the browser tab is still open

**"The changes aren't showing"**
- Press refresh in your browser (or F5)
- If Live Server is running, it should auto-refresh

**"Something broke"**
- Tell Claude! Type: "that didn't work, the button disappeared"
- Or type `restart` to start fresh

**"I want to start over"**
- Type `restart` in the terminal

## Have Fun! 🚀

Remember: there's no wrong way to do this. The goal is to experiment, learn, and create something fun!

The AI is here to help - if something doesn't work, just tell it what's wrong and ask it to fix it.
